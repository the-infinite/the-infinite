- 🔭 I currently work at [Monochrome Technologies](https://github.com/monochrome-tech)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Rust, Zig, Assembly, and UX design principles** (a bit of an odd mix I know 😆).
- 🔩 I’m currently making a full-stack framework in Dart named [DeepEnd](https://github.com/into-the-deep). This is becuase there's already enough of this written in JavaScript and last I checked, Flutter web is not performant enough to be used in production-grade application development. You can make it work though, but the effort needed is not negligible enough. On the side, I am also writing [Landmark](https://github.com/landmark-lang). Landmark, is a system's programming language that is kind of heavily inspired by Rust. The memory management model is similar to Rust's but just without any borrow-checking. If you want to find more out about Landmark, hopefully by the time you click that link, I'd have put something readable up there.
- 🤓 On a side note, I love anime too 🌚⭐
- If you want to reach out to me, feel free to use my contact information in my profile. 🌚⭐
